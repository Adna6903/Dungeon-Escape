ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This project is about creting a game called Dugeon Escape. The basic idea of this project is to escape the Dugeon 
and for that the player needs to clear all the 5 rooms. Rooms require keys to be cleared. Keys can be found randomly 
in the map along with treasure and some health portions. Also, player can get a key by defeating the monster
that is randomly spawned in the map. After clearing the rooms the player escpaes the Dugeon. But, before that
player needs to fight the sorcerer. If the player successfuly defeats the sorcerer the player wins and the game ends.
