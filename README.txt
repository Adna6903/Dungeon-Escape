ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
Dungeon Escape

Each session differs from the next, depending on the story made up by the dungeon master and the way the players react to that story. 
But most commonly, the game consists of a party of players making their way through a dungeon by fighting monsters, solving puzzles, 
and interacting with characters.Our game will use this general blueprint as inspiration. 
An evil Sorcerer has captured a group of players and trapped them in a monster-filled, labyrinthine dungeon for their own amusement. 
The goal of this game is to make it out of the dungeon with as many party members alive as possible.
Each turn in the dungeon makes you hungrier (reduces fullness) and has risks such as monsters and traps.
You can fight monsters, speak to NPCs, and explore, but you must make it through the dungeon before the Sorcerer
runs out of patience and destroys the dungeon, along with the player and all the party members!
